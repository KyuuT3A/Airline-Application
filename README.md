Airline-Application

The airline application, developed using C# and SQL, offers a simple experience for passengers and administrative staff. 

Passengers can effortlessly create accounts, select their preferred travel dates, and book flights according to their schedules. 

Administrators are empowered with a robust module that allows them to assign pilots and flight attendants to specific flights, schedule their duties, and create new flight assignments as needed. 

All procedures and data are securely stored in an SQL database, ensuring efficient management and retrieval of information, and enhancing the airline's overall operational efficiency.

The application interface is crafted using Visual Studio, providing a user-friendly and intuitive environment for passengers, administrators, pilots, and flight attendants.
